        <h2>Practical Examples and Demonstrations</h2>
        <p>Learning assembly language is best done through hands-on examples and practical demonstrations. Here, we provide a variety of assembly language examples to help you understand how to apply the concepts you've learned.</p>

        <h3>Example 1: Adding Two Numbers</h3>
        <p>In this example, we'll walk you through the process of writing assembly code to add two numbers together. You'll learn about loading values into registers, performing arithmetic operations, and storing the result.</p>

        <h3>Example 2: Conditional Branching</h3>
        <p>Conditional branching is a crucial concept in assembly language. We'll demonstrate how to use conditional jump instructions to create decision-making structures in your programs.</p>

        <h3>Example 3: Looping Constructs</h3>
        <p>Loops are essential for repetitive tasks. We'll show you how to implement loops in assembly language, allowing you to iterate over data structures and perform actions multiple times.</p>

        <h3>Example 4: String Manipulation</h3>
        <p>String manipulation is a common task in programming. You'll see how to work with strings in assembly language, including tasks like string comparison and concatenation.</p>

        <h3>Example 5: System Calls</h3>
        <p>Assembly language is often used for low-level system programming. We'll demonstrate how to make system calls to interact with the operating system, such as printing to the console or reading user input.</p>
